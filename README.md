# Unicode-Input-Browser-Extension

A browser extension for Firefox and Chrome. 

Allows entering of unicode characters by 4 character hex codes, e.g. 00e9 for e acute. Type in the code followed by the Insert key. Doesn't work on sites with very complicated frame set ups, e.g. Gmail or Twitter. Designed principally for use with Ex Libris Alma.

Version 2 aims to allow input exactly where the cursor is. 2.1 aims to correct the cursor position after input.

N.B.: The [Character Input](https://github.com/Orangeaurochs/Character-Input-Browser-Extension) browser extension is an update of Unicode Input, with support for Alt Key combinations and a more convenient method of inputting the copyright symbol. The Unicode Input browser will no longer be updated or supported unless simple corrections are identified and needed.
